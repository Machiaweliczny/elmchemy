# Elmchemy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wende/elmchemy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wende/elmchemy)
> Write Elixir code using Elm-inspired syntax (elm-make compatible)

## What is it?
Elmchemy is a project with one idea in mind: Seamless acommodation of Elm-like language on Erlang VM.

## Web demo
You can test `elmchemy` online at:
https://wende.github.io/elmchemy/stable/

### CAVEAT: Web version does *not* do any type checking. It only parses syntax. For full type and syntax checking run the CLI version

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [elm-lang](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html)

### Installation in Elixir project
Install `elmchemy` globally with

```shell
mix archive.install https://github.com/wende/elmchemy/releases/download/v0.0.1-mix-compiler/elmchemy-0.1.2.ez
npm install -g elmchemy
```

Then add it to your project by adding these two lines to your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
def project do
  [app: :my_app,
   ...
   compilers: [:elmchemy, :yecc, :leex, :erlang, :elixir, :app],
   elmchemy_path: "elm",
   ...
   ]
end
```

`elmchemy` will find all `*.elm` files specified in `elmchemy_path` and compile it into corresponding `*.ex` files in `lib` directory.

You can override output directory specifing `elixirc_paths`.

### Instalation as a standalone
```shell
npm install -g elmchemy
```
Usage
```
elmchemy compile source_dir output_dir
```
### Build from source

```
git clone https://github.com/wende/elmchemy.git
cd elmchemy
make compile
./elmchemy compile source_dir output_dir
```
and 
```
make dev
```
To launch and test the web demo

## Contributing Guide
- Everyone is welcome to contribute
- Refer to http://bogdanp.github.io/elm-ast/example/ to have better understanding of parsed tokens.

## Targeted values:
- Fully readable and indented elixir code generated from compilation
- Seamless and stressless interop with existing Elixir code, preferably with magically working type safety
- Full integration with entire elm syntax for editors and compilers magic

## TODO (priority desc)
- [X] Saving and reading from files
- [X] Basic API (operators, functions, monadic types [Maybe, Just etc])
- [X] Simple Elixir/Erlang interop
- [ ] Compiler built-in into elixir ecosystem

# FAQ
## Why *would* I want to use that
- You like types
- But even more you prefer compile-time errors over run-time error
- You prefer `add b c = b + c` over `defp add(a, b), do: b + c`
- You like curry
- You think failing fast is cool, but not as cool as not failing at all

## Why *wouldn't* I want to use that
- Your project relies on die-hard battle tested libraries, and you despise any versions starting with 0
- You're afraid that when you learn what Monad is your mustache will grow, and eyesight weaken

## Can I use it in already existing Elixir project
You can, but nice and dandy compile tools are still on their way

## Will my employer notice I'm having an affair with Elm?
The output files of Elmchemy treat the code readability as a first class citizen. The code is meant to be properly indented, the comments aren't omitted, and the code is optimized as hard as it can ( f.i case clauses reduce to function overloads)
Also auto-generated typespecs are on their way.
You might need some configuration files to compile your project, but if you don't do `git add --all` before every commit you'll be fine.

## When will Elmchemy become 1.0.0?
The answer is 42

## Can I contribute?
Definitely. Yes. Please do.

## How are types represented?
You're a nosy one, aren't you?
Elmchemy represents all type constructors as snake cased atoms, and all type applications as tuples.
Which means that `MyType 42 "Fourty two" Error` in Elm equals to `{:my_type, 42, "Fourty Two", :error}` in Elixir.
What means there's an additional premise to have in mind that even though in Elm `MyType 1 == (MyType, 1)` are two completely different things, in Elmchemy they're not. They're exactly the same. Which is `{:my_type, 1}`

## Can I use already existing Elm libraries with Elmchemy.
Probably not. Unless you know a way to override standard Elm modules with our implementation

## Can I use already existing Elixir libraries with Elmchemy
Yes. You can do an `ffi` call to any function in any module. Whether it's Elixir module, Erlang module, or even a macro you can include it in your code. Just remember to wrap them in as small chunks as possible to not sacrifice any type safety.

## But what about out of function macros? Like tests and `use Module`?
Unfortunatelly you can't write any macros with `do..end` blocks yet. You can write any out of function oneliners using Module meta feature:
```elm
meta = 
  [ "use GenServer" ]
```

## Can I define an Elixir macro in Elmchemy.
So you want to write an Elm-like code, that will manipulate Elixir code, which generates and Elixir code that manipulates Elixir code? How about no?

## Do I need to have elm installed to compile my `.elm` files with Elmchemy.
Ironically, no, you don't. Elmchemy is written entirely in Elm, which means the compiler is in JavaScript.
But it's nice to use `elm-make` to check your type safety from time to time.
